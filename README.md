# Deep map iteration

Concept test to measure and average what's the best way to iterate a complex map data structure.

To make this, I want to test some libraries to measure:

- [Iteraptor](https://github.com/am-kantox/elixir-iteraptor)
- [Lenses](https://github.com/obrok/lens) 
- recursive iteration

Check the result on this [link](https://github.com/daniikpando/deep-map-concept-test/blob/master/performance_results.md)
